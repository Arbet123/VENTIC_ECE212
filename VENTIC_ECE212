## Ask yourself:

1. Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?

    So I did a research why python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing and it turns out there are 6 main reasons. Number one reason is Python has built-in support for scientific computing, Python has bridges to MATLAB or Octave, Python is a highly extensible language, Python has very good input/output (I/O) options, Python has strong support for task automation and Python can use a web front end. In my personal opinion as I go deeper in learning Python is that, it is more easier so far in the basics part unlike in the other programming languages (e.g C++,Java,etc.)


2. If pyhton can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for?

     I think python is not applicable in Android phones, cause so far i don't see any apps that are run by andoid. So it is not fit for android app developers.
