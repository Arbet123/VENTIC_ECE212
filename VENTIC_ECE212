# Application

## Ask yourself:

1. Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?

    So I did a research why python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing and it turns out there are 6 main reasons. Number one reason is Python has built-in support for scientific computing, Python has bridges to MATLAB or Octave, Python is a highly extensible language, Python has very good input/output (I/O) options, Python has strong support for task automation and Python can use a web front end. In my personal opinion as I go deeper in learning Python is that, it is more easier so far in the basics part unlike in the other programming languages (e.g C++,Java,etc.)


2. If pyhton can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for?

     I think python is not applicable in Android phones, cause so far i don't see any apps that are run by andoid. So it is not fit for android app developers.
    
    
Exercise 1: Mailing Address (Solved, 9 Lines)

  Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing address. The address should be printed in the format that is normally used in the area where you live. Your program does not need to read any input from the user.
  
print("Emmanuel Arbet Ventic")
print ("Department of Electronics Engineering")
print ("USeP")
print ("Obrero, Davao City")
print ("Philippines")

Exercise 2: Area of a Room(Solved, 13 lines)

    Write a program that asks the user to to enter the width and length of a room. Once these values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. 
    The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.
    
#Compute the area of room 

#read the dimensions from the user
lenght =  float(input("Enter the lenght the room in ft"))
width = float(input("Enter the width off the room in ft"))

#Compute the area of the room
area = lenght * width

#display of result
print("The area of the room is", area, "square feet")

Exercise 3: Arithmetic (Solved, 22 lines)

Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should
compute and display:
• The sum of a and b
• The difference when b is subtracted from a
• The product of a and b
• The quotient when a is divided by b
• The remainder when a is divided by b
• The result of log10 a
• The result of ab
Hint: You will probably find the log10 function in the math module helpful
for computing the second last item in the list.

import math
#Reading numbers from user
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
#Calculating and printing sum
print(a,"+",b,"=",a+b)
#Calculating and printing difference
print(a,"-",b,"=",a-b)
#Calculating and printing Quotient
print(a,"/",b,"=",a/b)
#Calculating and printing product
print(a,"*",b,"=",a*b)
#Calculating and printing remainder
print(a,"%",b,"=",a%b)
#Calculating and printing log10 a
print ("math.log10(a) : ", math.log10(a))
#Calculating and printing log10ab
print ("math.log10(ab) : ", math.log10(a)+ math.log10(b))
